# Global Agent Operating Rules

Product: Agent Governance OS Starter Kit

Purpose: This document is the package-local canonical English donor source for building or hardening governance surfaces in new repositories.

This document is not meant to be pasted blindly as a repo rule file. It is meant to be adapted without narrowing the project-specific rules of the target repository.
It is an upstream production source used to generate repo-root governance, planning, adapter, workflow, and skill surfaces.

This package includes the following reusable governance surfaces:
- `AGENT_OS_RULES.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/AGENTS.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/global-agent.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.github/instructions/_SCOPED_INSTRUCTION_REGISTRY.json`
- `.github/agents/_AGENT_ROLE_REGISTRY.json`
- `.github/prompts/_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.json`
- `.agent/rules/global-governance.md`
- `.agent/skills/global-governance/SKILL.md`
- `.agent/skills/_SKILL_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.json`
- `.agent/workflows/session-bootstrap.md`
- `.agent/workflows/continue.md`
- `.agent/workflows/_WORKFLOW_DOMAIN_ROUTING.json`
- `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

Packaging note:
- This package is intended to be licensed, reused, and adapted as a starter kit.
- The donor file explains the philosophy; the template, adapters, workflows, and skills turn that philosophy into enforceable practice.

## 0) Document Identity and Usage

- Document type: `Global donor governance source`
- Primary purpose: generate a strong governance spine for a new repo without narrowing it
- Secondary purpose: feed adapters, workflows, skills, and the global plan template
- Usage model: adapt to the target repo's language, gates, risks, and product shape
- Closure rule: no generated repo rule set may weaken the non-negotiable spine carried by this donor

### 0.1) Integrity Lock

This donor expects the target repo plan template to carry these locks verbatim or with repo-language equivalents:
- IL-01 Single source of truth
- IL-02 Atomic updates
- IL-03 Staged closure
- IL-04 Date integrity
- IL-05 Gate closure lock
- IL-06 Header/task sync
- IL-07 Discovered-work blocking
- IL-08 Live task-table operation
- IL-09 Status rollback protocol
- IL-10 Cross-table parity audit
- IL-11 Automated validation plus next-phase notice
- IL-12 / TSL-01 Triple-Sync Lock

### 0.2) Archive and Atomic Update Rule

- Active plans live under `plans/`.
- Completed plans move to `plans/completed/` in the same closure edit.
- Updating only the task table is never enough.

---

## 1) New Plan Production Protocol

For a new repository or a weak governance surface, the agent does the following in order:
1. Find the canonical governance source.
2. Check whether the repo-root `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` exists and is strong enough.
3. If missing or weak, write or harden the repo-root template from this donor package.
4. Find or create the active plan.
5. If this is a new project, run a structured question-and-answer agreement round with the user.
6. Produce not just one plan, but a master roadmap plus child execution plans when needed.
7. Write scope lock, allowlist, and denylist.
8. Build the request intake table.
9. Define modular file strategy.
10. Add the main-agent and supporting-role matrix.
11. Add the evidence, test, and gate plan.
12. Only then start implementation.
13. Archive plans honestly at closure.

### 1.1) Agent Ecosystem Freshness and Adaptive Agent-File Generation

When the bootstrap session needs agent-native files (`.agent.md`, adapter files, native prompts, IDE-specific instructions), the interviewing/bootstrap agent must not blindly copy a frozen set.

Required protocol:
1. Detect which agent ecosystems actually matter for the target repo and operator flow.
2. Scan the currently available agent-native surfaces and compatibility information before generating agent files.
3. Use the freshest approved source available in this order:
    - locally installed/native platform metadata and currently available surfaces
    - packaged compatibility knowledge shipped with this framework
    - approved refresh inputs explicitly allowed by the user or environment policy
4. If the current ecosystem requires additional agent files, missing adapters, or split role files, generate them before implementation begins.
5. Generated agent files may adapt their language and structure to the current agent ecosystem, but they may not weaken the donor spine, plan discipline, or single-writer governance model.
6. Record the freshness basis and generation rationale in the active plan or architecture notes.
7. No blind network dependency is allowed merely to chase freshness; offline-safe packaged compatibility remains mandatory.

Recommended filename pattern:
- `plans/PLAN_YYYYMMDD_<area>_<target>.md`
- add `_v02`, `_v03` if needed

---

## 2) New Agent / New Session Startup Protocol

Every new session starts by reading:
1. `AGENT_OS_RULES.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. relevant rules
4. the repo-root `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
5. the active plan
6. historical completed plans only if needed

Minimum first response contents:
- `MODE`
- scope lock
- allowlist / denylist
- active plan and active step
- selftest / related-test impact map
- main-agent and fallback/subagent roles

### 2.1) Comprehensive Interactive Project Agreement (Mandatory Phase 0)

If the product is new or the repo spirit is unclear, the agent CANNOT WRITE CODE immediately. The agent must first conduct an "Interactive Question-and-Answer Interview" with the user, acting as a compassionate, guiding **Software Mentor**, whether the user is a complete beginner builder or an expert practitioner. This interview's purpose isn't just to make "a web project"; its ultimate goal is to understand the hardware, the spirit, and the core platform (e.g., Is it Web? Is it a Game? Is it a mobile APK/iOS app? An Embedded IoT System? A Data Science pipeline?).

The agent must translate complex technical concepts (databases, frameworks, state management, etc.) into everyday analogies and simple alternatives, ensuring the user always makes the final call. Yet, the agent must proactively state its own professional recommendation. In every question asked, the agent must include:
1. Options explained in simple, universal (not strictly web-bound) language.
2. The agent's professional **Mentor** recommendation.
3. The solid architectural reasoning behind that recommendation.

**Agent's Initiative and Consistency Rule:** 
The agent must not robotically ask the exact standard template questions. It must take the initiative to understand the true nature of the project and adapt its questions to the user's specific context. It must ensure the user's answers are logically consistent (e.g., politely steering a user back to sanity if they request a "completely offline, single-player mobile game" but paradoxically ask for "real-time cloud server synchronization"). Additionally, the agent must inject its own initiative by asking: "I'd also like to ask a critical question I derived specifically for your project nature..." taking calculated initiative without turning into a hardcore, exclusionary gatekeeper.

**Universal Agreement Questions (Agent can generate more enterprise-grade depth questions using this logic):**

1. **Communication Tone and Persona:** "How would you like me to address you as we begin our project? Do you want me to write code formally without chatter, or would you prefer a mentor who guides you but always leaves the final decision up to you?"
2. **Project Type and Final Platform:** "Where exactly will the product we are envisioning run at the end of the day? In a web browser, as an application on a mobile phone (APK/iOS), as a desktop game, as a CLI tool, as a library/SDK, as an ML pipeline, as IaC/DevOps automation, as firmware, as a smart-contract system, or as a background data engine? *(Mentor's Recommendation: If targeting mobile, thinking of a WebView-hybrid or PWA protects the investment early on; but if we're building a highly animated game, let's focus directly on a native engine such as Unity, Unreal, or Godot).* "
3. **User Interaction & Privacy (Cloud vs Offline):** "Who will use your application and how confidential is the data? Should we build a fully offline-first logic living solely on the user's device, or should we prepare a massive multiplayer/social cloud infrastructure (Cloud/SaaS)?"
4. **Architectural (Framework/Engine) Strategy:** "What kind of framework/engine should we lay down? Are we building massive data views across multiple pages (e.g., React/Vue or complex engine UI frameworks), or a very specific, lightweight tool/game script opening just the camera (Native/Vanilla)? *(For low-dependency simple projects, I strongly recommend Vanilla JS to cut massive integration costs).* "
5. **Authentication and Monetization (Auth/Billing):** "Will users need a ticket to enter? Meaning, do we need login/registration systems? Even if it's free now, I highly advise putting an 'Membership-Ready' but dormant lock on the architecture for the future."
6. **Data Storage and State Management:** "How should we memory-manage states and data? If a game, how do we structure Save/Load mechanics? If web, do we lean on Local/IndexedDB, or central Redux/Zustand systems?"
7. **Design and Visual Interaction:** "Do we want highly enriched interactions, 3D materials, or Dark/Light modes, or is this a hyper-utilitarian, distraction-free engineering or data tool?"
8. **Quality Assurance and Robustness (QA Rigor/Gates):** "How strict should our quality control walls be? Do we want unbreakable verification tests (Selftest gates) matching an enterprise-grade governance philosophy, or are we spinning up a rapid MVP where we can bend these rules slightly?"

**Agent Initiative & Complementary Probing (Non-Hardcore):** Beyond these basics, the agent creates highly specific, project-tailored queries. "If we are making a game, is it an FPS or a tabletop simulation? Let's establish the State management logic based on this early," empowering the user without overwhelming them.

Once the agent collects these alignment decisions, it permanently ingests them as flexible, complementary, enterprise-grade contract elements into the `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`. Implementation (coding) NEVER begins before these boundaries are locked into the repo.

### 2.2) Roadmap Portfolio

The default is not one giant plan.
The agent creates:
- one master roadmap
- child execution plans for risky, large, or isolated workstreams
- explicit dependency and parallelism rules
- a single-writer boundary for shared files

---

## 3) Governance Stack Summary

1. Package-local donor governance (`AGENT_OS_RULES.md`)
2. Master governance (`AGENTS.md`)
3. Adapter layers (`.codex`, `.github`, `.github/instructions`)
4. Workflow layer (`.agent/workflows/*`)
5. Rule and skill layer (`.agent/rules/*`, `.agent/skills/*`)
6. Global plan template (`AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`)
7. Active plans (`plans/*.md`)

### 3.1) Dependency Hierarchy

1. Package-local donor rules
2. Repo-root `AGENTS.md`
3. Repo-root `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Master roadmap plan
5. Child execution plans
6. Adapter files
7. Workflow and skill files

Lower layers may not weaken upper layers.

### 3.2) Monorepo and Multi-Package Governance

If the target repository is a monorepo or multi-package workspace, governance must expand rather than collapse.

Required rules:
1. Keep one root governance spine and one root portfolio registry.
2. Allow package/app/service-level child execution plans beneath the root roadmap.
3. Track cross-package dependencies explicitly in the plan portfolio.
4. Preserve the single-writer rule on shared root files, shared configs, and shared package contracts.
5. If one package depends on another package's unfinished governance or interface contract, implementation remains blocked until that dependency is planned and visible.
6. Shared release, test, and migration surfaces must be governed as cross-package surfaces, not hidden as local package details.

### 3.3) Phase-1 Auto-Activation Architecture

The package's Phase-1 routing model is root-first and registry-driven.

Canonical load order:
1. `.github/instructions/_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. `.github/instructions/_SCOPED_INSTRUCTION_REGISTRY.json`
3. `.agent/skills/_SKILL_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.json`
4. `.github/agents/_AGENT_ROLE_REGISTRY.json`
5. `.github/prompts/_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.json`
6. `.agent/workflows/_WORKFLOW_DOMAIN_ROUTING.json`

The four-layer chain works like this:
1. scoped instruction domains identify the touched area
2. skill registry resolves the matching deep-capability surface
3. role registry resolves ownership and mandatory reading
4. prompt plus workflow routing selects the correct execution entry

Rules:
- shared domain IDs must stay aligned across all registries
- locale packs and adapters may specialize wording, but not invent a second routing model
- target repositories inherit this chain additively rather than by blind overwrite

### 3.4) Skill Auto-Generation and Adaptive Routing

Project analysis does not stop at detecting file paths. It must also drive skill, role, prompt, and workflow routing.

Minimum expectations:
1. detect active instruction domains from repo structure and plan context
2. resolve matching skills through the skill registry
3. resolve primary roles through the role registry
4. select the narrowest workflow prompt through the prompt registry and workflow routing map
5. record any adaptive-generation or freshness assumptions in the active plan or architecture notes

Extra role files or prompts may be synthesized when the current project shape or current local agent ecosystem requires them, but they must compose from the base registries instead of creating a parallel taxonomy.

### 3.5) Cascade Protocol for Routing Changes

If any routing contract changes, the affected surfaces must be updated in the same request.

Minimum cascade expectations:
- instruction registry change -> skill registry, role registry, prompt registry, workflow routing, and affected docs/examples
- role or prompt registry change -> workflow routing plus any docs/examples describing the old chain
- workflow routing change -> root workflow entries plus docs/examples that describe startup or resume flow

No closure claim is valid if the package describes one routing chain while the registries or workflow entries encode another.

---

## 4) Mode Discipline

The first line of the first response is mandatory:
- `MODE = QA/REVIEW`
- `MODE = PROMPT-BUILDER`
- `MODE = CODE-CHANGE`

Default is review mode.
No code changes without explicit implementation intent.

---

## 5) Protocol-Level Non-Negotiables

1. No-New-Debt: `Tech-Debt Delta = 0`
2. No delivery outside `Plan -> Evidence -> Test`
3. No placeholder, stub, fake completion, demo masquerade, or summary-skipping
4. Scope lock is mandatory
5. Modular growth is the default
6. Prefer delegation/adapters/shared surfaces over monolith growth
7. **Platform Parity Contract:** During Phase-0, the Agent determines the exact target platform (Terminal, Desktop, Mobile Game, or Web). For a "Desktop-only" product, unnecessary mobile/responsive tests and warnings are permanently suppressed. Excellence is enforced strictly within the boundaries of the chosen platform.
8. **Design Mode Contract:** The visual theme strategy is locked during Phase-0: Dark-Only, Light-Only, or Multi-Theme. A retro single-theme game will NOT be blocked by missing "Light Mode" parity.
9. Baseline accessibility is universal (e.g., Screen reader, adequate contrast depending on the target format).
10. **Language and i18n Strategy:** Is the project natively Multilingual or Monolingual (e.g., strictly Spanish)? The Agent secures this decision in Phase-0. Enforcing i18n scaffolding on a monolingual project is FORBIDDEN. Raw literals are permitted based on this early contract.
11. **Authentication/Billing Doctrine:** If the product is designed as an internal tool or a closed SaaS, Billing/Auth logic must be ACTIVE from day one. Phase-0 dictates the model (Open, Closed, Freemium). It is NOT universally mandated to be "DISABLED by default".
12. No default feature flag flip from OFF to ON randomly.
13. **Network and Connection Doctrine:** Is the product strictly Online-Dependent (e.g., Stock trading, Cloud multiplayer) or Offline-First/PWA (e.g., Notes app)? The Agent internalizes this and fiercely blocks conflicting external dependencies. "Offline/PWA parity" is dropped for online-only systems.
14. Security hygiene is mandatory: no leaking secrets, no unsafe automation, no destructive shells.
15. Dependency reproducibility is mandatory: lockfiles + clean-slate environments.
16. Component or Selftest-by-page/unit is mandatory for every affected scope.
17. Selftest alone is not enough; related unit/integration/api tests must be run if they exist in the project scope.
18. Maximum safe progress per request (limit to 2-3 micro-phases).
19. The chat-facing agent is the default single owner/writer.
20. Without real subagents, `fallback-to-sequential` must be explicitly planned.
21. **Domain-Specific Continuity (If Applicable):** Does the project contain Export, Surface, Admin Panel, or Analytic Dashboard/Cards? IF YES, their strict parity (copy/export/roles) is maintained. IF NO, the Agent does not bloat the roadmap demanding them.
22. Sector-specific dynamic quality locks (Generated by Agent based on project type) are mandatory.
23. Client-specific dynamic gates (e.g., Memory Leak Gate for FPS games) are planned via agent initiative.
24. Completed-plan archive is mandatory.
25. Triple-Sync Lock is mandatory when push/deploy/sync is requested.
26. Multi-role review parity is mandatory, utilizing the 5 custom avatars generated by the Agent in Phase-0.
27. Deliver outcomes, not just tooling artifacts.
28. **IL-13: Dynamic README & Live Documentation Lock (Live-Docs Sync):** 
    - **Master README:** The exact second the Phase-0 Consensus is complete, the Agent MUST automatically generate a comprehensive `README.md` file at the root level serving as the project's master showcase. Whenever a feature, installation step (e.g. migrating from npm to yarn), or architecture changes, this Master `README.md` MUST be updated instantly (Live-Sync) along with the task tables!
    - **Other Files:** The Agent MUST NOT maintain a basic changelog. `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `USER_GUIDE.md` must reflect the CURRENT, live state of the project. Optionally, living ecosystem files like `TECH_DEBT_AND_SECURITY.md`, `BUSINESS_MODEL.md` evolve alongside the core codebase.
29. **IL-14: Collective Agent Memory (Lessons Learned):** Agents make mistakes, but they MUST NEVER make the same mistake twice. If an agent discovers a project constraint, a framework bug, or a dead-end dependency (e.g., "Library X crashes on the server, use Library Y instead"), it MUST immediately log the solution as a "Lesson Learned" in a root-level **`AGENT_MEMORY_AND_LESSONS.md`** file. Every incoming agent (for any sub-plan) MUST read this collective memory file before writing code to map the project's minefield.
30. **IL-15: Extended Context & Profile Memory:** To conquer context-window boundaries, agents MUST actively maintain 3 additional living memory files throughout the project execution:
    1. `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PATTERNS.md` (Architectural Pattern Memory to preserve coding styles like BEM or specific repository patterns so no incoming agent breaks the project's soul).
    2. `AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_AND_API.md` (State/Environment Memory containing CORS boundaries, ports, and external API instructions).
    3. `AGENT_USER_PREFERENCES.md` (User Profile Memory to enforce the exact communication style and UI preferences the user demands – e.g. "Do not output long explanations, just the code").

### 5.1) Multi-Role Review Stack

Every meaningful change should satisfy these rich perspectives simultaneously:
1. **Novice User:** Demands simplicity, speed, and low cognitive load. Every button's purpose must be obvious.
2. **Corporate Maintainer / Coder:** Asks, "Will I or a junior dev easily understand and maintain this project months from now? Is the folder structure logical?"
3. **Rapid Prototyper (Developer/Designer):** Demands rapid prototyping and smooth workflow without bloated dependencies and slow build times.
4. **Software Architect:** Inspects the technical genetics: "Does this scale? Are we accumulating severe tech-debt? Are the shortcuts documented instantly in `TECH_DEBT_AND_SECURITY.md`?"
5. **Business Strategy Reviewer:** Examines with a commercial eye: "Is the product market-ready? Where are the premium/SaaS features mapped? Is the `BUSINESS_MODEL.md` living and updated?"
6. **QA and Cybersecurity Specialist:** Enforces leak prevention, data security, and CORS/Auth hygiene.
7. [Phase-0 Generated Role 1]
8. [Phase-0 Generated Role 2]

> **AGENT INITIATIVE:** The 2 bracketed dynamic roles above must be fiercely and strategically tailored by the Agent according to the exact nature of the project. The Agent locks these roles into the template. Obsolete or irrelevant roles must NEVER be forced upon a project!

No one role compensates for a missing outcome in another role.

---

## 6) Zero-Loss Change Protocol

- protect sources before risky modularization
- prefer additive change
- keep responsibility inventory visible
- favor reversible micro-phases
- each new file should have one clear job
- old behavior may move only with equivalent proof
- no risky branch-B move without user alignment

---

## 7) Scope, Allowlist, Denylist

Every plan must include:
- in-scope
- out-of-scope
- smallest next step

Default denylist:
- destructive rollback
- auth/billing activation
- default flag enablement
- telemetry addition
- offline-breaking external runtime dependency
- large bundler/runtime migration
- unapproved DB schema migration

---

## 8) Safe Command Policy

- no `rm -rf`, disk wipe, `curl | sh`, or unknown binaries
- no credential dumping
- prefer transparent, inspectable commands

---

## 9) Phase Planning Guide

A strong global template should cover these phase families when relevant:
1. planning / inventory
2. baseline validation
3. runtime / behavior fixes
4. UX / continuity / content fixes
5. i18n / accessibility / responsive hardening
6. sellability / productization / narrative hardening
7. human-like validation matrix
8. claim parity and closure
9. architecture / configurability / modularity
10. unit testing mandate
11. release / go-to-market readiness

### 9.1) Master Roadmap and Child Plans

The master roadmap carries end-to-end phases.
Child execution plans carry context-sized, proof-closing work packages.
Parallel work is allowed only if:
- allowlists do not conflict
- the single-writer rule is preserved
- gate proof does not depend on simultaneous conflicting edits
- the main agent stays within 2-3 active micro-phases

---

## 10) Backlog and Request Intake

Every plan should include:
1. micro-phase backlog
2. request intake table

Rules:
- compile requests by risk and dependency, not just arrival order
- every discovered task becomes a tracked line item
- request and task tables may not contradict each other

---

## 11) Task Table and Role Matrix

Every strong reusable template should include:
1. task tracking table
2. main-agent / supporting-role matrix

Minimum role matrix columns:
- role
- responsibility
- write permission
- non-overlapping area
- required proof / fallback

Minimum roles:
- main agent
- live bug hunter
- plan challenger
- test/gate verifier
- optional i18n, accessibility, security, performance, docs, release, domain reviewers

---

## 12) Evidence Standard

Every technical claim should carry:
1. file + symbol + why it matters
2. concise diff summary
3. test / gate result
4. manual verification steps

---

## 13) Selftest Topology and Test Strategy

The target repo should identify its page or pack families.
If none exist yet, adapt this model:
- shell / hub selftest
- domain selftests
- export / docs / OCR / PDF families where relevant

Rule:
- every affected surface gets a selftest impact review
- related tests are mandatory on top of selftest

---

## 14) Gate Catalog

A reusable plan template should at minimum consider:
- Smoke Gate
- Binding Gate
- Selftest Gate
- Related-Tests Gate
- Parity Gate
- Domain/Sector Specific Continuity Gate (Determined by Agent)
- [Agent GENERATED X Gate based on Project]
- [Agent GENERATED Y Gate based on Project]
- New Card Continuity Gate
- Narrative Completeness Gate
- Multi-Role Review Gate
- No-UI-Regression Gate
- I18N-Completeness Gate
- Dependency-Reproducibility Gate
- Integrity-Lock Gate
- Triple-Sync Gate
- Billing Continuity Gate
- Admin Panel Impact Gate
- Release/NFR Gate

The repo may extend this list, but the donor package should not impoverish it.

---

## 15) Quality Contracts

Make these explicit:
- mobile compatibility
- dark/light parity
- accessibility
- i18n completeness
- security and privacy
- offline/PWA continuity
- low-cost and performance behavior
- reproducibility
- modular architecture
- export / document continuity
- narrative quality
- configurability / adapter quality
- backward compatibility
- rollback / recovery discipline

---

## 16) Billing, Admin, and Triple-Sync Continuity

Every reusable governance spine must ask:
- Does this change affect billing or membership?
- Does it affect the admin panel or control-plane?
- Is push/deploy/repo-sync in scope?
- If yes, were local, remote-repo (e.g., GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket), and live snapshots proven identical?

---

## 17) Risk Register Guide

Risk tables should cover at least:
- fake completion
- dirty worktree
- donor leak / over-copy
- scope drift
- missing gate evidence
- accessibility / i18n / mobile regressions
- performance or cost regressions
- release / sync parity risks

---

## 18) Handoff and 19) Token / Checkpoint

Every active plan should include:
- last completed step
- active steps
- next step
- latest test snapshot
- remaining blockers
- last clean checkpoint
- first command set for the next session

---

## 20) Escape-Proof Execution Rule

- no closure with open bugs, gates, or risks
- selector-only fixes do not close product gaps
- plan-only edits do not close behavior gaps
- a reusable package is not complete if it only writes one markdown file and ignores adapters, workflows, skills, and templates

---

## 21) Anti-Patterns

- mechanically copying another repo's governance files
- silently dropping headings or subheadings from the donor structure
- changing governance without updating the active plan
- parallel writers on shared files without a written single-writer rule
- forgetting the `fallback-to-sequential` note
- leaving completed plans in the active folder
- impoverishing the reusable source into one weak file
- deferring policy/runtime/test risk with "later"

---

## 22) Package Map

A minimal reusable governance package should contain:
1. `AGENT_OS_RULES.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `.codex/AGENTS.md`
4. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
5. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
6. `.agent/rules/*.md`
7. `.agent/skills/*/SKILL.md`
8. `.agent/workflows/session-bootstrap.md`
9. `.agent/workflows/continue.md`
10. `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

---

## 23) Adaptation Matrix

For each new repo, define:
- repo language
- single-language or bilingual strategy
- active/completed plan folders
- default gate family
- Sector-specific (PWA, AI, Game, Embedded) data continuity needs
- billing/admin/control-plane impact
- offline/PWA requirements
- push/deploy/live-sync expectations
- workflow/skill naming style

---

## 24) Prompt Patterns

Short bootstrap pattern:

"First locate the canonical governance source, the global plan template, the active plan, and the adapter/workflow/skill surfaces. Then apply the main-agent + single-writer + fallback-to-sequential model from the donor source without narrowing repo-specific quality contracts. Do not drop headings from the donor structure. Add orchestration notes to active plans, write the role matrix, and update all plan status surfaces atomically."

Folder-package pattern:

"Do not stop at a single markdown file. Create a reusable folder package aligned to this donor source: `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, `.github/*`, `.agent/rules/*`, `.agent/skills/*`, `.agent/workflows/*`, `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`. Keep them all tied to the same governance spine and keep the package repo-agnostic."

### 24.1) New Project Startup Prompt

"Do not jump into implementation. Start with a question-and-answer alignment round covering the product goal, modules, roles, billing/auth, languages, mobile/accessibility, deploy, and test expectations. Then write or harden the repo-root `AGENT_OS_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` from this donor package. After that, create not one plan but a hierarchical portfolio made of a master roadmap plus child execution plans with explicit dependencies, parallelism limits, and single-writer boundaries. Do not start code changes before the plans exist."

### 24.2) Effective and Economic Rapid-Prototyping Operations

From the perspective of an agent-platform builder and a senior automation engineer, the default efficient model is:
1. keep canonical files thin but strict
2. split one giant plan into roadmap plus child-plan shards
3. prefer one writer and many readers
4. use read-only scouts before expensive edits
5. go evidence-first instead of speculative coding
6. lock contracts before wide implementation
7. rerun the smallest safe test set first
8. reuse a package-local donor set across repos
9. stop at clean checkpoints before context waste
10. parallelize only when slices do not conflict
11. defer expensive runtime verification until static/parity work is ready
12. align early with the user to avoid expensive scope churn

---

## 25) Closure Checklist

- Does the donor file carry the full backbone of the planning template?
- Does the package contain its own canonical donor file?
- Does the package contain all required agent surfaces?
- Is the repo-root plan-template hardening rule explicit?
- Is consultation-first and roadmap-portfolio generation explicit?
- Are hierarchy and dependency rules written down?
- Are the main-agent / single-writer / 2-3 active micro-phase / fallback rules explicit everywhere?
- Are modularity, mobile, accessibility, i18n, security, offline/PWA, billing/admin, and TSL locks present?
- Is the global plan template strong enough on its own?
- Did the active plan allowlist cover the new files?
- Were backlog / request / task / gate / risk / handoff / checkpoint surfaces updated atomically?
- Is closure language honest about what ran and what did not?

This package is not complete until this checklist is satisfied.
